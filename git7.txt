                     One of the first things I do when I’m given a
                     manuscript to typeset is do a global find and
                     replace to make sure none of the paragraphs begins
                     with a tab (I search for paragraph breaks followed
                     by a tab and then replace them with only paragraph
                     breaks). Putting a tab at the beginning of a paragraph
                     is a holdover from typewriter days when that was the 
                     easiest way to put a half-inch indent at the beginning
                     of a new paragraph. There are worse ways to indent a
                     paragraph, but we’ll get to those shortly.
